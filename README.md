# Installation

```bash
yarn install
yarn data:update
```

# Development

```bash
yarn start
```

# Deployment

Deployment is automated to happen every day and each time a commit is pushed to the `prod` branch. The published website is then pushed on the `gh-pages` branch.

Therefore :

- Contents and data are updated every day
- To deploy a new version of the website code, push it to the `prod` branch.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
